# Water_Quality_Monitoring
Water quality is a crucial factor affecting public health, agriculture, and the environment. This project applies machine learning algorithms to predict water quality based on key parameters such as pH, turbidity, hardness, conductivity, sulfate levels, and organic carbon content. By leveraging data-driven insights, the model helps classify water as potable or non-potable, providing an automated approach for real-time monitoring and decision-making.

Key Features:
Dataset: Utilizes publicly available water quality datasets (e.g., Kaggle, EPA, WHO).
Machine Learning Models: Implements Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, and ANN for classification.
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, normalizes data, and selects relevant features for optimal model performance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes trends, correlations, and distributions of water quality parameters.
Model Evaluation: Assesses performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusionÂ matrix.
